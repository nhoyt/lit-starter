# lit-starter

Use this template to set up a minimal development environment for using the
[Lit library](https://lit.dev/).

The environment utilizes two main development packages:
* [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/)
* [Web Dev Server: Modern Web](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/)

These packages, along with their plugins and configurations, were chosen based
on recommendations in the Lit Documentation section entitled
[Tools and Workflows](https://lit.dev/docs/tools/overview/) as of March 2022.

Please see the following files for more info:
* `package.json`
* `rollup.config.js`
* `web-dev-server.config.js`
